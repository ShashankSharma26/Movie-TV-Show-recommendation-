# Data preperation 

All the datasets used for this project are sourced directly from IMDB, which can be viewd and downloaded from this link https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/

The datasets are normalised to third degree, hence the data prep jupyter notebook retreives the required columns of data from different datasets and creates two csv files:

1) title_information.csv- This file contains all the information regarding a tiltle including title type(movie ot tv show), genre, year of release, language and rating. 

2) Cast information: This file contains the information of actors, actresses and director for each title.

Please view the jupyter notebook for a detailed explanation of each step to create the two csv files.
